GOALS:
======
	going for a mostly POSIX vi implementation, completely excluding an actual UI
	library to be used by other programs looking for vi functionality
	no escape key handling
	no escape character sequence handling
	ex mode, normal mode, input mode

START:
======
	create a pointer to a vl_buff and initialize it
		vl_buff *new = vl_init();

INPUT:
======
	functions to take in keys from keyboard
		vilib_q_input  -  inputs regular chars
		vilib_q_special_input  -  input 'special' keys (movement keys, escape key)
			up to host program to decipher escaped chars

OUTPUT:
=======
	output list of 'cooked mode' keys equivalent to inputted actions
		vl_atom **vilib_cooked_output(vl_buff *buff);

	output text of specified portions of the internal buffer

DEFINES:
========
	types of vl_atoms, and types of special keys
		typedef enum { VL_UP, VL_DOWN, VL_RIGHT, VL_LEFT, VL_BACKSPACE, VL_END, VL_HOME, VL_DELETE, VL_CHAR } vl_type;

	modes
